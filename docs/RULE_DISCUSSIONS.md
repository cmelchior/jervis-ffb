# Rule Discussions

This file contains interesting discussions about rule ambiguities and how the rules should be
interpreted.

1. Chainsaw vs. Mighty Blow: https://fumbbl.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=33049
   You cannot use MB _against_ the player that has Chainsaw

2. When resolving Both Dow during a Block. Who is resolved first: Attacker or Defender?

3. When selecting skill usage. Who goes first? E.g. choosing Dodge/Tackle f or Stumble

4. In which order is skill usage declared when both teams have to choose? E.g. Break Tackle and Diving Tackle?
   Is it "Active then InActive", "InActive then Active", "Active Coach Decides" or "InActive Coache Decides"

5. It is a bit unclear if Sweltering Heat or Deal with Secret Weapons happens first, but Sweltering heat 
   does mention "once a drive ends", which matches the "The Drive Ends" step of the End of Drive sequence.

# Differences compared to the rules as written

1. (Page 74) The rules make it optional to use a skill before or after a roll. In Jervis, if possible, 
   this choice always come after the roll. There is no valid reason for asking it before, and asking
   both before and after would create a lot of noise.

2. (Page 37) Rolling for the weather should be done by each coach rolling once dice. This doesn't
   matter in this case, so both dice are just rolled as a single step.
