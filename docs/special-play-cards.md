# Special Play Cards

In Blood Bowl 2020, there is an huge number of Special Play cards. 48 comes with the base
game, but then each team also has a set. In total there are more than 300 different cards.

It has been a bit tricky finding an official source for all of them, so far this list is the 
closest, but it is lacking newer teams: https://mega.nz/folder/bipQASbT#dBEw4HEbYuR3RjFKl1HbsQ/folder/TqwHWCaZ

I have a copy of the universal cards myself.

Ideally, all of these cards should be implemented, but it has a lesser priority than getting
the rest of the rules in place.

TEAM-SPECIFIC DECKS
When drawing cards, the team can choose a team-specific deck (2x8) to draw from instead of 
randomizing any of the universal decks (6x8).

Universal decks: 6
Team-specific decks: 2

DRAW CARDS
Universal: Randomize which deck to draw from (1-6).
Team-specific: Choose a team-specific deck to draw from.

For each card, draw 2, keep 1.
