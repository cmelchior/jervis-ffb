# Rule Discussions

This file contains interesting discussions about rule ambiguities and how the rules should be
interpreted.

1. Chainsaw vs. Mighty Blow: https://fumbbl.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=33049
   You cannot use MB _against_ the player that has Chainsaw

2. When resolving Both Dow during a Block. Who is resolved first: Attacker or Defender?

3. When selecting skill usage. Who goes first? E.g. choosing Dodge/Tackle f or Stumble

4. In which order is skill usage declared when both teams have to choose? E.g. Break Tackle and Diving Tackle?
   Is it "Active then InActive", "InActive then Active", "Active Coach Decides" or "InActive Coache Decides"





# Differences compared to the rules as written

5. (Page 74) The rules make it optional to use a skill before or after a roll. In Jervis, if possible, 
   this choice always come after the roll. There is no valid reason for asking it before, and asking
   both before and after would create a lot of noise.
