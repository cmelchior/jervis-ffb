# TourPlay Net

This module contains the infrastructure to work with [TourPlay](https://tourplay.net). 
This currently includes:

* Read team data and convert it into a Jervis compatible team.

The Rest API wrappers were autogenerated from sample output, so most likely bugs
will be present. In particular, it looks like some `Int` might be `Long`.

Also, we miss a mapping between TourPlay players and FUMBBL player icons.
So right now, they just use the auto-generated player sprites.


## Tips for using the TourPlay API

TourPlay does not provide a public, stable API, so this module uses their
internal API used to render the TourPlay website.

This requires setting a few required headers:

```
curl --location 'https://tourplay.net/api/rosters/44442' \
--header 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
--header 'Referer: https://tourplay.net/en/blood-bowl/roster/44442' \
--header 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36'
```

The site also loads an `en.json` (probably `en` is the language) file that 
contains some mappings. This file e.g. contain Team Special Rules.
